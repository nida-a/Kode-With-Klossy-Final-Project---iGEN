     <p>Operating systems (OS) are a type of software that runs in your computer. Software are a sets of programs, or instructions, that tell the computer what to do. The software of a computer is one of the two main parts of computer, the other being the hardware. Operating systems are programs that communicate with the hardware of a computer, and it allows other programs to run in the background. It manages the computer's memory, functions, and hardware, and it makes sures that individual hardware devices work together and properly with other programs. It is the most important software on your computer, and computers are useless without an operating system. It also makes it possible to install games, social media, and other apps. Operating systems allow you to communicate with your computer without knowing how to speak its language.</p>
     <h2>Common OS for Personal Computers</h2>
     <p><b>Microsoft Windows</b> was created in the mid-1990s. There are many different versions of this operating systems, and it is preloaded on most personal computers (PCs). </p>
     <p><b>macOS</b>, previously OS X, is an operating system from Apple. It is preloaded on all Macintosh computers, or Macs.</p>
     <p><b>Linux</b> is an open-source operating system, which means that it can be modified and distributed by anyone in the world. It is different from proprietary software, like Windows and macOS, which can only be modified by the company that owns the operating system. Linux is free of cost, and there are many different distributions, or versions.</p>
     <p>Even though there is a grand variety of operating systems, most of the basic principles are similar.</p>
     <h2>Graphical User Interface</h2>
     <p>The graphical user interface, or GUI, is a part of the operating system that lets the computer's mouse click buttons, icons, and menus on its screen. It  is in charge of displaying graphics and text clearly on the screen</p>
     <h2>Mobile Operating Systems</h2>
     <p>Mobile operating systems are operating systems have been specifically designed for mobile devices like phones, tablets, and MP3 players.</p>
     <p>Some examples of mobile operating systems are:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Apple iOS</li>
       <li>Google Android</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Mobile operating systems have less features than operating systems that were made for desktops and laptops. They're not able to run all of the same software as PC operating systems, but they are still capable of doing many things.</p>
