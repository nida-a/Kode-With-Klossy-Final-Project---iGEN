 <p>The Internet is a network, or system, that connects millions of computers worldwide. Networks are groups of connected computers that share information and resources. The devices that a family owns are all part of a home computer network). The internet is a world-wide system of connected computer networks, and it is a giant network of smaller networks.</p>
  <h2>History of Internet</h2>
  <p>Modern internet began in the early 1990s. Tim Berners-Lee created the tools and framework for World Wide Web.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>He created the first web browser called worldwideweb</li>
    <li>He created HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which creates the structure of websites</li>
    <li>He created HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which web browsers use to communicate with computers that store websites</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  
  <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<p><b>Website:</b> publicly accessible group of pages on World Wide Web that contains hyperlinks (links that connect webpages/websites together) to each other and share single domain name)<p> 
<p><b>Ethernet:</b> allows computers to communicate on network with wires, developed in 1970s, protocol/rules for how devices communicate using cables </p> 
<p><b>Wireless:</b> allows computers to communicate on network without wires, developed in late 1990s, protocol for using radio waves to send info through air to connected devices (Wi-Fi is popular way to connect to wireless network, wireless fidelity, taken from term high fidelity, which describes high-quality audio)</p> 
<p><b>WAN:</b> wide area network, connected LANs far from each other (different parts of country/world)</p>
<p><b>Packets:</b> small units of data that are sent in binary code through a network, sent individually and recombined on device, used to send large amounts of information over the internet</p> 
<p><b>IP (interned protocol) address:</b> used to direct packets to right network, unique addresses label devices on network/internet, all devices have it, they can change and are assigned by internet service provider (company that provinces people access to internet)</p> 
<p><b>LAN:</b>local area networks, made up of nearby computers </p>
<p><b>HTML:</b>hypertext markup language, used to create websites, built for connecting websites together</p>
<p><b>Host:</b> stores website, looking up a website is asking for host to send copy of site </p>
<p><b>Servers:</b> specialized computers that usually hosts, massive amounts of storage, fast internet connections, run specific software</p>
<p><b>HTTP:</b> hypertext transfer protocol, rules for sharing web content, used by web browsers to communicate with servers and allow computer to download website, website addresses start with HTTP or HTTPS (securer, adds layer of security by encrypting/coding all transferred data)</p>
<p><b>URL:</b>uniform resource locator, address, all websites on internet have </p>
<p><b>DNS:</b> domain name system: databases that translate website URLs to IP addresses of server hosting site, computer uses IP address to find server and ask for access to HTML files of website, all happens in less than a second</p>
<p><b>TCP:</b> transmission control protocol, rules computers use when transferring info (website, picture, video) across internet, host servers follow this when transferring website to computer</p>
<p><b>UDP:</b> user datagram protocol, other way to transfer info, focus more on speed than getting every single packet to final destination, useful when speed is more important than getting all requested info </p>

<!--  Networks are groups of connected computers that share info and resources (devices family owns are all part of home computer network)
LAN: local area networks, made up of nearby computers
Ethernet: allows computers to communicate on network with wires, developed in 1970s, protocol/rules for how devices communicate using cables

Internet (connection/network between devices) is not world wide web (collection of websites linked together through internet, content)
HTML: hypertext markup language, used to create websites, built for connecting websites together
Host: stores website, looking up a website is asking for host to send copy of site
