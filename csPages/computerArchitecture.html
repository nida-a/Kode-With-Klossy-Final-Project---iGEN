    <h1>Computer Architecture</h1>
    </header>

    
   <section class="content"> 

    <p>Computer architecture is a general term for the hardware of computers, or the physical parts of a computer. These are the parts of the computer that can be seen with your eyes. There are many different parts that make up a computer.
  </p>
    
    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    <p>The motherboard is a circuit board that computer components use to communicate through. Itâ€™s like the glue that holds everything in the computer together, and it also contains some other small parts of the computer. </p>
    
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>Input devices send external information to the computer. Some input devices are a keyboard, a mouse, a game controller, and a webcam.
  </p>
    
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>Output devices are components that the computer uses to send information to its user. Some examples of output devices include a projector, a monitor, a printer, speakers, and headphones.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Storage devices are used by the computer to store information. Hard drives and CDs are storage devices.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>USB (Universal Series Bus) flash drives, also known as thumb drives and USB sticks, are portable plug-in storage devices.</li>
      <li>The RAM (Random Access Memory) is a storage part with a volatile memory, which means that it gets erased every time the computer restarts. It stores data regarding frequently accessed programs, and it helps apps start up and close fast.
  </li>
      <li>An HDD (Hard Disk Drive) is an actual disk that stores data, and itâ€™s read by a mechanical arm.</li>
      <li>An SSD (Solid State Drive) is a storage device similar to an HDD except for the fact that it has no moving parts, and itâ€™s faster than an HDD since it doesnâ€™t spend time waiting for a mechanical arm to find data on a physical location.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Processors</h2>
    <p>Processors run programs, interpret input, and supply output.
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer, and it has a direct connection to the motherboard. It receives input and carries out commands from other hardware and software. The CPU breaks down instructions given by a peson into a language the processor can understand, assembly language.
  </li>
      <li>The GPU (graphics processing unit) is the graphics card, and it delivers images, animations, and videos that can be viewed on a computer screen. It communicates directly with the display monitor.</li>
    </ul>
