    <h2 id="compLit" >What is Computer Literacy?</h2>
    <p class = "compLitInfo">Computer literacy is the knowledge and skills required for the basic use of computer hardware, software and the Internet. These critical computer and Internet skills are highly valued in todayâ€™s academic and professional environments. Sharpening these skills can help lead to success in education and employment, as computer skills are integral to all areas of study and work.

    <h2 id="compLitImportance">Why Is Computer Literacy Important?</h2>
    <p class="compLitImportanceInfo">The importance of computers cannot be understated - our daily lives function are based off of computing. From banking to education, the world is heavily reliant on this technology. Despite this, many people are unable to properly use computers and struggle with basic functions that are a necessity in today's world. This can lead to people being unable to perform basic tasks, such as paying bills and sending an email, thus perpetuating further problems.</p>
    <p>Computer illiteracy also impacts opportunities for people. For example, they may not be able to get a job because they cannot apply or because the job requires basic computer skills. Additionally, people can also become vulnerable to attacks such as phishing or scams because they do not understand how computers work.</p>
    <p><b>iGEN</b> seeks to solve computer illiteracy by empowering users with basic computer skills.</p>
